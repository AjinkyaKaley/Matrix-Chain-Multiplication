# Matrix-Chain-Multiplication
This program finds the most efficient way to multiply the matrices.
The complexity of this program implementation is  O(n^3) and it taks O(n) to parenthesize the final output

Input specification: the first line contains n and the next line contains a0, ..., an, separated by spaces. It is assume that all the numbers are positive and fit in int and that n is at most 100. 
Output specification: the output contains one line with an optimal parenthesizing printed in the following form
( ( A1 x ( A2 x A2 ) ) x ( A3 x A4 ) ) 

This program taks the input from std input
To run this program execute the following command

javac MatrixChainParenthesize.java

java MatrixChainParenthesize
